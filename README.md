# presskit-static()

A Hugo theme for generating static presskit()-like sites. No PHP necessary!

presskit-static() is a theme you can use with Hugo to generate a presskit as static HTML, which you can then upload to Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. You don't need to run a dedicated server for your Presskit, and you don't need to worry about your hosting provider going down (both S3 and GCS provide at least 99.9% uptime SLA). As an added bonus, S3 and Google Cloud Storage are often orders of magnitude cheaper than paying for shared hosting or a VPS.

## Getting Started

### 1. Initial setup

First you need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). It's available for every major operating system. Once this is done, you should be able to type "hugo" at the command line.

Create a new Hugo site with:

```
hugo new site
```

With your new site created, [download the presskit-static ZIP](https://github.com/RedpointGames/presskit-static/archive/master.zip) and place it in the `themes/` directory such that `themes/presskit-static/theme.yaml` exists.

Add the line `theme = "presskit-static"` to your `config.toml` or `theme: "presskit-static"` to your `config.yaml` file.

You can run Hugo as a server locally while you're writing content to preview it by running `hugo server -t presskit-static` in the directory where your project is located.

### 2. Add pages

You now need to add pages to the `content/` directory.  You can copy the files inside `content-examples/` directory to your content directory to get a presskit up and running quickly.

### 3. Add images

You can add logos, videos and images to your presskit site by placing resources in the following directories, with the same layout used as in the PHP-version of presskit():

- `static/<id>/images` - For image files
- `static/<id>/images/images.zip` - For a ZIP file of all images
- `static/<id>/images/logo.zip` - For a ZIP file of all logos
- `static/<id>/logos` - For logos
- `static/<id>/trailers` - For .mp4 or .mov trailers (games only)
- `static/<id>/videos` - For .mp4 or .mov videos (companies only)

The `<id>` is the value of the `id: ` field in the company or game document. Unlike the PHP version of presskit(), this allows for multiple companies and games to have their own assets.

### 4. Generate HTML files

From the command line, run:

```
hugo -d ./dist
```

The `dist` folder will now have a set of static HTML files, images and other assets you can directly upload to S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

## Options

### Enable responsive Bootstrap

By default, presskit-static uses the same theming as the official presskit project to ensure compatibility with existing presskits that want to migrate. However you can enable a Bootstrap-enabled responsive layout by adding the following property to any pages you define:

```yaml
style: bootstrap
```

### Custom styling

You can add custom styles to any page by placing `.css` files next to the `images` folder inside `static` for any given page. This is only supported on Bootstrap-enabled pages.
